Universal Game Skelton
----------------------

IMPORTANT!!!

As much as there is "universal" in the name of this library and all
the original well-meaning of its authors, this is so terminally
hacked-up that you would probably go mad trying to use this in a new
project. One obvious example is that Xlib support is in "svgalib".

DUH, OF COURSE! :-)

You are much better off using something like SDL or Clanlib.
