Quadra 1.2.0

 * Added a notification of new versions in the title screen, as well
   as automatically updating the public game server address.

 * Quadra now requires Internet Explorer 5 on Windows.

 * Store high score recordings and configuration file in a
   user-specific application data directory, so that non-administrator
   users can play on Windows NT/2000/XP.

 * Added a fullscreen mode to the X11 driver, which is now the
   default. Use "-nofullscreen" if it gives you problems.

 * Removed support for Svgalib.

 * Added a "-boringrules" option to disable the reduction in attack
   strength normally applied in crowded games. This should remove any
   need to run older version of Quadra for rule purposes.

   CD music).

 * Added a "-connectfile" option to read from a specified file a
   server address to connect to.

   joining a game.

 * Fixed high CPU usage on recent Linux systems.

 * Use the new Quadra master server at SourceForge.

 * Added a User-Agent to Quadra's HTTP client code.

   space requirements of Quadra have been cut in half!).

 * Various bugs fixed.

Quadra 1.1.6

 * Version numbering will now be of the "major.minor.patchlevel"
   format, where an even "minor" number means a stable release and
   an odd "minor" number means a development release (similar to the
   Linux kernel version numbering).

 * Fixed possible security holes.

 * Quadra is not SUID root anymore, to avoid security
   problems. Only the Svgalib driver requires root privileges. You can
   either run "chmod 4711 /usr/games/quadra" or play the game as root.

   available.
