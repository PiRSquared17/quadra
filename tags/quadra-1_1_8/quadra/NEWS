   space requirements of Quadra have been cut in half!).

 * Various bugs fixed.

Quadra 1.1.6

 * Version numbering will now be of the "major.minor.patchlevel"
   format, where an even "minor" number means a stable release and
   an odd "minor" number means a development release (similar to the
   Linux kernel version numbering).

 * Fixed possible security holes.

 * Quadra is not SUID root anymore, to avoid security
   problems. Only the Svgalib driver requires root privileges. You can
   either run "chmod 4711 /usr/games/quadra" or play the game as root.

   available.
