Quadra Source Release
---------------------
$Id$

This is a raw source release. Do not smoke near this package.

Basic instructions:

 - type 'make'

There you go! There is a 'quadra' binary and a 'quadra.res' resource
file in the quadra/source directory. If not, then something went
wrong. :-)

You can run this with the following command (in bash):

QUADRADIR=. LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../skelton/lib ./quadra

Good luck!
