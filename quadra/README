Quadra Source Release
---------------------
$Id$

This is a raw source release. Do not smoke near this package.

Requirements:

 - a C++ compiler (gcc was tested on Linux and Visual C++ on Windows)
 - zlib (http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/)
 - DirectX 5 (Windows only)
 - Svgalib (Linux only, http://svgalib.org/)
 - X Window System libraries with XPM support (Linux only)

Basic instructions:

 - type 'make'

There you go! There is a 'quadra' binary and a 'quadra.res' resource
file in the quadra/source directory. If not, then something went
wrong. :-)

You can run this with the following command (in bash):

QUADRADIR=. LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../skelton/lib ./quadra

Good luck!
