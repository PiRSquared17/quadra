Quadra Source Release
---------------------
$Id$

This is a raw source release. Do not smoke near this package.

Requirements:

 - a C++ compiler (gcc was tested on Linux and Visual C++ on Windows)
 - zlib (http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/)
 - libpng (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
 - DirectX 5 (Windows only)
 - Svgalib (Linux only, optional, http://svgalib.org/)
 - X Window System libraries with XPM support (Linux only)

Basic instructions:

 - type './configure'
 - type 'make'

There you go! There is a 'quadra' binary, a 'quadra-svga.so' driver and
a 'quadra.res' resource file in the quadra/source directory. If not,
then something went wrong. :-)

You can run this with the following command (in bash):

QUADRADIR=source source/quadra

Good luck!
