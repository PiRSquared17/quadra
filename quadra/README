Quadra Source Release
---------------------
2000/07/25

This is a raw source release. Do not smoke near this package.

Basic instructions:

 - go in the 'skelton' subdirectory (no, this is not a typo!)
 - type 'make'
 - go back in the root directory of the package
 - type 'make' again

There you go! There is a 'quadra' binary and a 'quadra.res' resource
file in the quadra/source directory. If not, then something went wrong.
