Quadra 1.1.7

 * Registration code now completely removed.

 * All image resources have been converted to PNG format (the disk
   space requirements of Quadra have been cut in half!).

Quadra 1.1.6

 * Version numbering will now be of the "major.minor.patchlevel"
   format, where an even "minor" number means a stable release and
   an odd "minor" number means a development release (similar to the
   Linux kernel version numbering).

 * Fixed possible security holes.

 * Quadra is not SUID root anymore, to avoid security
   problems. Only the Svgalib driver requires root privileges. You can
   either run "chmod 4711 /usr/games/quadra" or play the game as root.

 * Svgalib is no longer strictly required, but will be used if
   available.

 * Partial PNG support in resource file.

 * Improved README file.

Quadra 1.1.5

 * Fixed portability problems to Win32.

 * 'skelton' is now built automatically.

 * Started removal of the registration system.

 * ISO C99 support, for gcc 2.96.
    - Bernhard Rosenkraenzer <bero@redhat.de>

 * Red Hat 7.0 support.
    - Bernhard Rosenkraenzer <bero@redhat.de>

 * Fixed building on some distributions.
    - Simon Cahuk <simon.cahuk@uni-mb.si>

 * First open source version.
