Glory to the last man standing!

The game is divided in rounds. A round ends
when only one team has any member alive. Then,
everybody restarts with the same series of
pieces on a clean canvas.

If you die, you will have to wait until the
beginning of the next round to play again.

Enter a breakneck race for points!

There is no way to attack your opponents, so
the goal is to score as many points as possible.

Attack strongly to confuse your opponents!

Instead of receiving lines from your
attacks, your opponents will receive
blind pieces. Those pieces will stay
invisible for 5 seconds after being
placed.

Clear lines to get rid of the hot potato!

The team holding the hot potato receives all the
attacks from everybody else without being able to
fight back so it must get rid of the potato as
fast as possible.

Each team gets the hot potato in turn and must make a
certain amount of "attack" lines to get rid of it.
