Quadra Source Release
=====================

This is the Quadra source release.

Requirements
------------

 - a C++ compiler (gcc was tested on Linux and Visual C++ on Windows)
 - zlib (http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/)
 - libpng (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
 - DirectX 5 (Windows only)
 - X Window System libraries with XPM support (Linux only)

Building on Unix-style systems
------------------------------

To compile and install this software on a Unix-like system, do this:

$ make (if you checked out the source code from Subversion)
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install (optional)

There you go! There is a 'quadra' binary, a 'quadra-svga.so' driver
and a 'quadra.res' resource file in the top-level directory. If not,
then something went wrong. :-)

You can run this with the following command (in bash):

QUADRADIR=. ./quadra

If you ran the "make install" command, then you have 'quadra'
installed on your system and you can just run it (no need to set
QUADRADIR).

Building on Windows systems
---------------------------

To compile Quadra on a Windows machine, use the Visual C++ workspace
and project file in the VisualC++ subdirectory. Make sure you have
zlib, libpng and DirectX properly installed for development on your
machine.

Any questions?
--------------

If you have any problem, patches, suggestions, bug reports or are
simply looking for help, please take advantage of the resources

Good luck, and have fun!
