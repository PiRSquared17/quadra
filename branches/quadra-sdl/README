Quadra Source Release
=====================

This is the Quadra source release.

Requirements
------------

 - a standard-compliant C++ compiler (gcc 4.0 was tested on Linux and
   Visual C++ 2008 on Windows)
 - zlib 1.2 or greater (http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/)
 - libpng 1.2.0 or greater (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
 - SDL 1.2.10 or greater (http://www.libsdl.org/)

On Ubuntu, the following packages are needed to build:

 - g++
 - libpng12-dev
 - libsdl1.2-dev
 - make

Building on Unix-style systems
------------------------------

To compile and install this software on a Unix-like system, do this:

$ make (if you checked out the source code from Subversion)
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install (optional)

There you go! There is a 'quadra' binary and a 'quadra.res' resource
file in the top-level directory. If not, then something went
wrong. :-)

You can run this with the following command (in bash):

QUADRADIR=. ./quadra

If you ran the "make install" command, then you have 'quadra'
installed on your system and you can just run it (no need to set
QUADRADIR).

Building on Mac OS X
--------------------

A common problem on Mac OS X is that the libpng library is not
available. This is relatively easy to work around, by downloading the
libpng sources (available at http://libpng.sourceforge.net/, look for
a libpng-1.2.X.tar.gz file), compiling them (no need to install it on
your system!) and then adding a "--with-libpng=/path/to/libpng" to the
"configure" command line.

Building on Windows
-------------------

To compile Quadra on a Windows machine, look for the folder 'VisualC++'
and open up 'quadra_sdl.sln' (tested using Visual C++ 2005 Express
Edition). Go in menu Tools / Options, and select Projects and Solutions,
VC++ Directories. Make sure you have zlib, libpng and SDL paths in both
'include files' and 'library files'.
I have tested with the following version:
  zlib-1.2.3
  libpng-1.2.12 (see below for build instruction)
  SDL-1.2.13
(note: on my system, I have added these paths to include files:
	C:\work\zlib-1.2.3
	C:\work\libpng-1.2.12
	C:\work\SDL-1.2.13\include

	and these paths to library files:
	C:\work\libpng-1.2.12\projects\visualc71\Win32_LIB_Release
	C:\work\zlib-1.2.3\projects\visualc6\Win32_LIB_Release
	C:\work\SDL-1.2.13\lib
Your setup should be relatively similar.)

By default, your workspace should be set to 'Debug'. Build the solution.
Fix any missing lib or includes if necessary. If all builds, don't 
launch the app yet. You now need to build the main ressource file using
'wadder', an utility that was built in the Quadra solution. You can
launch this utility through a batch file called 'res.bat' found in the
same folder as the VC++ solution. If the tool works properly, it should
output a 'quadra.res' in the parent folder, along with 'quadra.exe' which
*should* already be there (simply by building the solution).

Important notice: For a "more" enjoyable debugging/developping experience,
I recommend you pass a command argument '-nofullscreen' in VC properties
under Configuration Properties / Debugging. Else you might end up getting
stuck on a breakpoint in a 640x480x8 bit display mode with a locked 
keyboard.

Run "res.bat" after building to create the resource file (quadra.res).

How to build LIBPNG on Windows
------------------------------
I am using libpng-1.2.12 but newer version should work mostly the same way.
Open up libpng-1.2.12\projects\visualc71\libpng.sln. Select your current
configuration as 'LIB Release' in order to compile a .lib that Quadra will
link to. Edit the project setting (configuration LIB Release). In 
'Configuration Properties' / 'C/C++' / 'Code Generation', make sure that
'Runtime Library' is set to 'Multi-Thread (/MT)'. Build.

How to build ZLIB on Windows
----------------------------
I am using zlib-1.2.3 and like libpng, newer version should work too. Open
up zlib-1.2.3\projects\visualc6\zlib.sln (or zlib.dsw if the solution does
not exist, and Visual Studio will ask to create a solution). Select the 
configuration as 'LIB Release', Edit the project setting. In 
'Configuration Properties' / 'C/C++' / 'Code Generation', make sure that
'Runtime Library' is set to 'Multi-Thread (/MT)'. Build.
