Quadra Source Release
=====================

This is the Quadra source release.

Requirements
------------

 - a C++ compiler (gcc was tested on Linux and Visual C++ on Windows)
 - zlib (http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/)
 - libpng (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
 - SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/)
 - X Window System libraries with XPM support (Linux only)

Building on Unix-style systems
------------------------------

To compile and install this software on a Unix-like system, do this:

$ make (if you checked out the source code from Subversion)
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install (optional)

There you go! There is a 'quadra' binary and a 'quadra.res' resource
file in the top-level directory. If not, then something went
wrong. :-)

You can run this with the following command (in bash):

QUADRADIR=. ./quadra

If you ran the "make install" command, then you have 'quadra'
installed on your system and you can just run it (no need to set
QUADRADIR).

Building on Mac OS X
--------------------

A common problem on Mac OS X is that the libpng library is not
available. This is relatively easy to work around, by downloading the
libpng sources (available at http://libpng.sourceforge.net/, look for
a libpng-1.2.X.tar.gz file), compiling them (no need to install it on
your system!) and then adding a "--with-libpng=/path/to/libpng" to the
"configure" command line.

Building on Windows
-------------------

To compile Quadra on a Windows machine, look for the folder 'VisualC++'
and open up 'quadra_sdl.sln' (tested using Visual C++ 2005 Express
Edition). Go in menu Tools / Options, and select Projects and Solutions,
VC++ Directories. Make sure you have zlib, libpng and SDL paths in both
'include files' and 'library files'.
I have tested with the following version:
  zlib-1.2.3
  libpng-1.2.12
  SDL-1.2.11
By default, your workspace should be set to 'Debug'. Build the solution.
Fix any missing lib or includes if necessary. If all builds, don't 
launch the app yet. You now need to build the main ressource file using
'wadder', an utility that was built in the Quadra solution. You can
launch this utility through a batch file called 'res.bat' found in the
same folder as the VC++ solution. If the tool works properly, it should
output a 'quadra.res' in the parent folder, along with 'quadra.exe' which
*should* already be there (simply by building the solution).
Important notice: For a "more" enjoyable debugging/developping experience,
I recommand you pass a command argument '-nofullscreen' in VC properties
under Configuration Properties / Debugging. Else you might end up getting
stuck on a breakpoint in a 640x480x8 bit display mode with a locked 
keyboard.

Any questions?
--------------

If you have any problem, patches, suggestions, bug reports or are
simply looking for help, please take advantage of the resources
available on our web site (http://quadra.sourceforge.net/)! Among
others, we have a support request system, mailing lists, a bug
tracking system and plenty of other goodies, check it out!

Good luck, and have fun!
