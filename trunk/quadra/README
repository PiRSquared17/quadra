Quadra Source Release
=====================

This is the Quadra source release.

Requirements
------------

 - a C++ compiler (gcc was tested on Linux and Visual C++ on Windows)
 - zlib (http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/)
 - libpng (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
 - DirectX 5 (Windows only)
 - X Window System libraries with XPM support (Linux only)

On Ubuntu, the following packages are needed to build:

 - g++
 - libpng12-dev
 - libx11-dev
 - libxpm-dev
 - libxxf86vm-dev
 - make

Building on Unix-style systems
------------------------------

To compile and install this software on a Unix-like system, do this:

$ make (if you checked out the source code from Subversion)
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install (optional)

There you go! There is a 'quadra' binary and a 'quadra.res' resource
file in the top-level directory. If not, then something went
wrong. :-)

You can run this with the following command (in bash):

QUADRADIR=. ./quadra

If you ran the "make install" command, then you have 'quadra'
installed on your system and you can just run it (no need to set
QUADRADIR).

Building on Mac OS X
--------------------

A common problem on Mac OS X is that the libpng library is not
available. This is relatively easy to work around, by downloading the
libpng sources (available at http://libpng.sourceforge.net/, look for
a libpng-1.2.X.tar.gz file), compiling them (no need to install it on
your system!) and then adding a "--with-libpng=/path/to/libpng" to the
"configure" command line.

Building on Windows
-------------------

To compile Quadra on a Windows machine, use the Visual C++ workspace
and project file in the VisualC++ subdirectory. Make sure you have
zlib, libpng and DirectX properly installed for development on your
machine.
