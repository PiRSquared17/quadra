Quadra 1.1.6 (in development)

 * Fixed possible security holes.

 * Quadra is not SUID root anymore, to avoid security

   either run "chmod 4711 /usr/games/quadra" or play the game as root.

 * Improved README file.

Quadra 1.1.5
 * Fixed portability problems to Win32.

 * 'skelton' is now built automatically.

 * Started removal of the registration system.

 * ISO C99 support, for gcc 2.96.
    - Bernhard Rosenkraenzer <bero@redhat.de>

    - Bernhard Rosenkraenzer <bero@redhat.de>

 * Fixed building on some distributions.
    - Simon Cahuk <simon.cahuk@uni-mb.si>
