	* Incorporating various changes for public release.

1999-10-26  Pierre Phaneuf  <pp@ludusdesign.com>

	* svgalib/input_x11.cpp: Added bare support for input methods, just
	enough so that dead keys will work.

1999-10-21  Pierre Phaneuf  <pp@ludusdesign.com>

	* common/net.cpp: added a SO_REUSEADDR socket option to the TCP socket
	in Linux so that you can restart the game server right away.

1999-10-01  Pierre Phaneuf  <pp@ludusdesign.com>

	* Added a precise frame counter to the Xlib implementation.

	* Improved X dirty rectangle handling a bit to do less superfluous color 
	conversions.

1999-07-19  Pierre Phaneuf  <pp@ludusdesign.com>

	* X11 keyboard handling is done, and all the drawing primitives
	are there.

1999-07-14  Pierre Phaneuf  <pp@ludusdesign.com>

	* X11 support is mostly in, missing some drawing primitives,
	keyboard handling isn't there and sound seems to have some problems.

1999-07-08  Pierre Phaneuf  <pp@ludusdesign.com>

	* The input and video subsystems are now semi-dynamic, with better
 	error handling and improved terminal restoration.
	
1999-06-04  Pierre Phaneuf  <pp@ludusdesign.com>

	* Disabled the Ctrl-c key in svgalib/input.cpp.

	* Fixed a bug in the RegistryLinux::read() method, there was no
	terminating NULL at the end of the returned string.

	* Moved alt_tab out of the #ifdef UGS_DIRECTX, Inter::draw_zone()
 	needed it.
